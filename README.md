# Bus-Seat-Occupancy-Detection
🚌 Bus Seat Occupancy Detection System using ESP32
This project is a smart, low-cost solution designed to monitor seat occupancy in public transport using an ESP32 microcontroller. It uses IR sensors to detect whether seats are occupied and displays the number of available seats in real-time on a 16x2 LCD screen via I2C. Ideal for improving efficiency and enhancing passenger experience in buses and similar systems.
