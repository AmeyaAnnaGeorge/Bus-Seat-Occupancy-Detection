# Bus-Seat-Occupancy-Detection
A smart bus seat occupancy detection system using ESP32, IR sensors, and a 16x2 LCD to display available seats in real-time. Designed for efficient passenger monitoring in public transport. Compact, low-cost, and scalable.
ðŸšŒ Bus Seat Occupancy Detection System using ESP32
This project is a smart, cost-effective solution to monitor seat occupancy in public transportation using an ESP32 microcontroller. The system uses multiple IR sensors placed on each seat to detect whether a seat is occupied or vacant. Based on sensor input, the total number of available seats is calculated and displayed in real-time on a 16x2 LCD display via I2C interface.

The project aims to help drivers and operators quickly understand seat availability, improving efficiency and passenger experience. It is particularly useful in situations where manual monitoring is not feasible, such as in large or crowded buses.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Real-time detection of seat occupancy

Live display of remaining seat count

Compact and efficient design using ESP32

Simple hardware setup with IR sensors and I2C LCD

Easily scalable to any number of seats

ðŸ’¡ Applications:
Public buses, school buses, or private transport fleets

Miniature models or academic demonstrations

Integration into smart city transportation systems

ðŸ§  Technologies Used:
ESP32 Microcontroller (Arduino framework)

Infrared (IR) sensors for seat detection

16x2 LCD with I2C for display

Arduino IDE for coding and uploading firmware

ðŸŒ± Future Scope:
Integration with mobile apps for live tracking

Cloud data logging and analytics

GSM or Wi-Fi-based alert systems when the bus is full

Use of ultrasonic or weight-based sensors for more precision
